# New Zealand Border Movements Analysis

## 1. Business Context
International travel plays a critical role in New Zealand’s tourism sector, population change, and labour supply. Border movements are influenced not only by overall travel demand, but also by traveller characteristics, travel modes, and entry or exit points.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, New Zealand experienced significant border restrictions and a gradual reopening process. Understanding how border movements have changed across different time periods, traveller groups, and travel modes is essential for assessing recovery patterns and structural shifts in international travel.

This project analyses detailed daily border movement data to examine how arrivals and departures vary by time, citizenship, travel mode, port, and demographic characteristics, with a focus on comparing pre-COVID, COVID, and post-COVID periods.

## 2. Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyse daily international border movement data from 2019 to 2025 in order to identify long-term trends, recovery patterns, and structural differences in New Zealand’s border activity across different time periods, traveller groups, and travel characteristics.

## 3. Key Analysis Questions
This project seeks to answer the following questions:

1. How have border arrivals and departures changed over time from 2019 to 2025, particularly across pre-COVID, COVID, and post-COVID periods?
2. Is New Zealand experiencing net population inflow or outflow, and how does this vary across different time periods?
3. Are there clear seasonal patterns in border movements, and do these patterns differ by travel mode (air, cruise ship, other sea)?
4. How do border movements differ by traveller characteristics such as citizenship, age group, and sex?
5. Are there notable differences in border activity across ports and closest overseas countries, and have these patterns changed over time?

## 4. Data Source
- **Source**: Stats NZ – International travel (provisional)
- **Website**: https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/international-travel-provisional/
- **Time period**: January 2019 – December 2025
- **Data granularity**: Daily border movements

The dataset includes detailed variables describing each border crossing, including date components (year, month, day), travel direction (arrival or departure), traveller citizenship, travel mode (air, cruise ship, other sea), port of movement, closest overseas port and country, and demographic attributes such as age group and sex.

The time span of the data allows comparison across three key phases:
- Pre-COVID period (2019)
- COVID and border restriction period (2020–2022)
- Post-COVID recovery period (2023–2025)
